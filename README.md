# Armaan's Pokedex

Rip off pokedex, because why not?

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install all dependencies using `yarn`
3. Add pokemon data using `yarn setup-db`

## Notes

Currently, we only have 1271/1279 records in the database. The most likely reason is API rate limiting which is the reason we couldn't get the last 8.
